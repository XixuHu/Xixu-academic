Hi! My name is HU Xixu and I am a second year PhD student at the School of Data Science. I am lucky to be co-supervised by [Prof. WU Qi](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/qiwu55.htm) and [Prof. ZHANG Qingpeng](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/zhang.htm). My research experience lies at the intersection of domain adaptation and causal inference. I work closely with [Dr. MA Shumin](https://dst.uic.edu.cn/fm_en/faculty/faculty.htm#/shuminma/en) and [Dr. YUAN Zhiri](https://hk.linkedin.com/in/zhiri-yuan-a4ab2290).
